# Bootchart

On this page, we showcase collected boot charts.

We collected boot charts of the original OS, LineagOS, and SDIOS for the devices Lancelot and Oneplus3t, which show that SDIOS has no negative impact on boot time.

The boot chart image includes a small text description, two graphs, and a process listing, which are too large to be included in this paper. First, the text shows information about the OS, device, and total booting time in seconds. The first graph shows the total CPU consumption. The blue indicates the percentage of CPU usage, and the red shows the I/O wait. The second graph shows disk utilization in percentages.
The graphs in SDIOS and LineageOS are almost identical. However, the graph in the original OS looks different; this is expected due to the difference in boot and Android software between LineageOS and the proprietary OS.
